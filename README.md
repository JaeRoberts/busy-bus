# busy-bus

This code is for a public transportation project I was assigned during my Bloc apprenticeship. The assignment involved three phases: research, design, and frontend development. The code here was created to fulfill the latter, for which I developed the mockup I made as a solution to the assigned problem. This repository consists of the code for both the light theme and dark theme for this assignment.
